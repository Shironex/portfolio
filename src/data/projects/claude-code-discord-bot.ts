  summary:
    'Discord bot that executes Claude Code on GitHub repositories via workflow dispatch, creating automated PRs from Discord prompts and images.',
  description: [
    'Claude Code Discord Bot is a fun experimental project that enables agentic coding directly from Discord. Users can trigger Claude Code to execute tasks on any repository by sending prompts and error screenshots through Discord slash commands. The bot dispatches GitHub Actions workflows that run Claude Code autonomously, implementing fixes, adding features, or refactoring code based on the prompt, then automatically creating pull requests with the changes.',
    'Built with NestJS and Necord in just a couple of days, the bot provides an interactive Discord interface for repository search, prompt submission with image attachments, and real-time workflow monitoring. It uses a custom GitHub Actions workflow template that users add to their repositories, which handles the Claude Code execution and PR creation. The entire process happens automatically - from Discord message to GitHub PR - without manual intervention.',
    'While the project has some rough edges and unfinished features, it demonstrates the potential of agentic coding workflows triggered through chat interfaces. The Turborepo monorepo structure with automated CI/CD using Changesets shows solid engineering practices, making it a good foundation for future development into a more polished tool for Discord-based development workflows.',

    architecture:
      'Claude Code Discord Bot follows NestJS modular architecture with clear separation between commands, interactions, and services. The bot uses Necord for type-safe Discord.js integration, with dedicated modules for slash commands, button interactions, modal submissions, and select menu handlers. Services handle business logic including GitHub API interactions via Octokit, workflow dispatching, and session management. The Turborepo monorepo structure enables future package sharing and scalability. Automated CI/CD pipelines handle quality checks, versioning, and releases using changesets and GitHub Actions.',
